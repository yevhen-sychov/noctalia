This file collects contributor-facing details for Noctalia: design goals, stack notes, code style, source layout,
runtime asset behavior, and debugging helpers.

For dependencies and normal build commands, start with [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).

Before contributing, read our [ethos](https://noctalia.dev/ethos) to understand the values and philosophy guiding the
project.

## Design Principles

- Direct Wayland + OpenGL ES only -- no toolkit overhead
- Minimal scene graph, domain-specific to shell UI
- Packaging should work across all major Linux distros: Arch, NixOS, Fedora, Gentoo, Debian, Void, OpenSuse

## Stack

Direct project dependencies are listed below; transitive dependencies are owned by their providing system packages.

| Layer | Library |

| Dynamic loading | `libdl` when provided separately by the platform |
| Text | `cairo`, `cairo-ft`, `pango`, `pangocairo`, `pangoft2`, `harfbuzz`, `freetype2`, `fontconfig` |
| Images | `Wuffs` (vendored), `stb_image_resize2`, `stb_image_write`, `libwebp`, `libjxl`, `libjxl_threads`, `librsvg` |

| Authentication | `PAM`, `polkit-agent-1`, `polkit-gobject-1` |
| Credentials and encryption | `libsecret-1`, `libsodium` |
| HTTP | `libcurl` |

## Runtime Assets

`meson install` installs the binary and shipped assets separately using the normal prefix layout:

```text
/usr/local/bin/noctalia
/usr/local/share/noctalia/assets/...
```

With a different Meson `prefix`/`datadir`, the same structure is preserved under that prefix.

Noctalia needs the `assets/` tree at runtime. Copying only the bare `noctalia` binary is not enough.

Portable bundle layouts are also supported:

```text
bundle/
  noctalia
  assets/
```

```text
bundle/
  bin/noctalia
  share/noctalia/assets/
```

Runtime asset lookup order:

1. `NOCTALIA_ASSETS_DIR`
2. `assets/` next to the executable
3. `assets/` one level above the executable
4. install-style `../share/noctalia/assets` relative to the executable
5. the compiled install path from Meson (`<prefix>/<datadir>/noctalia/assets`)
6. the source-tree `assets/` directory as a development fallback

An asset root is only accepted if it contains the expected shipped files such as `emoji.json`, `fonts/noctalia-tabler.ttf`,
`templates/builtin.toml`, and `translations/en.json`.

## Code Style

This project uses [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) for formatting. Run `just format`
before committing.

For editor integration, `just configure` creates a root `compile_commands.json` symlink to the selected Meson build
directory. Run `just configure`, `just configure release`, or `just configure asan` for the build mode you want clangd
to use.

The repo also includes `lefthook.yml`. Run `lefthook install` to install the pre-commit hook; it runs `just format`
before commits and refreshes the git index for tracked formatting changes.

Do not use em dashes (—) or double hyphens (--) as sentence punctuation, in code, comments, documentation, or commit
messages. Use a comma, colon, semicolon, or parentheses instead.

### Naming Conventions

| | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Files | snake_case | `widget_factory.cpp` |
| Directories | snake_case | `shell/bar/widgets/` |
| Types / Classes | PascalCase | `WidgetFactory` |
| Functions / Methods | camelCase | `createWidget()` |
| Variables / Parameters | camelCase | `busName` |
| Private members | m_camelCase | `m_changeCallback` |
| Macros / Enum values | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_SIZE` |

D-Bus wire-protocol string literals, such as `player["bus_name"]`, stay snake_case because they are wire names, not
C++ identifiers.

## Translations

Noctalia translations are managed through [Noctalia Translate](https://i18n.noctalia.dev/projects/noctalia). The JSON
files in `assets/translations/` are exported from that workflow, with `assets/translations/en.json` acting as the
source catalog for new strings.

When a code, UI, settings, or documentation change needs a new user-facing string, add or update the English string in
`assets/translations/en.json` only. Do not machine translate strings, copy English into other locales, or include broad
updates to non-English translation files in a normal feature or bug-fix PR. The translation team handles those locale
updates through the translation app.

Only edit non-English translation files when the PR is explicitly about translation tooling, an import/export sync, or a
maintainer has asked for that specific locale change.

After adding or renaming translation keys, run:

```sh
python3 tools/i18n-check.py
```

## Debugging

All debug commands use the `dev.noctalia.Debug` D-Bus service, available at runtime.

```sh
# Enable verbose debug logs
gdbus call --session --dest dev.noctalia.Debug --object-path /dev/noctalia/Debug --method dev.noctalia.Debug.SetVerboseLogs true

# Disable verbose debug logs
gdbus call --session --dest dev.noctalia.Debug --object-path /dev/noctalia/Debug --method dev.noctalia.Debug.SetVerboseLogs false

# Check current verbose log state
gdbus call --session --dest dev.noctalia.Debug --object-path /dev/noctalia/Debug --method dev.noctalia.Debug.GetVerboseLogs

# Emit an internal notification (app_name, summary, body, timeout_ms, urgency 0-2)
gdbus call --session --dest dev.noctalia.Debug --object-path /dev/noctalia/Debug --method dev.noctalia.Debug.EmitInternalNotification "Noctalia" "Test" "Hello from debug" 5000 1
```

### Crash output

When reporting a crash, include the complete terminal output from the process if it is available. Do not paste only
`Segmentation fault`; that line does not contain a useful stack trace or the error context.

### ASan crash reports

AddressSanitizer (ASan) can find memory errors that a normal build reports only as a crash. It requires a temporary
source build; it does not replace the Noctalia package you already use.

Install the source-build dependencies for your distribution using the commands in
[BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#dependencies), then clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia.git
cd noctalia
```

Stop the Noctalia instance started by your compositor, then configure and build ASan:

```sh
just configure asan && just build asan
```

Start the ASan binary in the foreground and save its output:

```sh
ASAN_OPTIONS=log_path=/tmp/noctalia-asan ./build-asan/noctalia 2>&1 | tee noctalia-asan-terminal.log
```

Reproduce the crash once. If Noctalia does not exit, press `Ctrl+C`. Attach both `noctalia-asan-terminal.log` and every
`/tmp/noctalia-asan.*` file to the GitHub issue. The files in `/tmp` preserve the ASan report if the crash takes down
the terminal. If the build or startup fails, attach that complete output instead.
